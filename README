================

Django Email Manager (emailmgr) is an application that helps with post-registration email management".
``You can associate multiple email addresses to a single Django User.``

This application comes into the picture only after a user has been created, activated
and logged in.

If your requirements is for email management prior to user registration please take a 
look at ``django-registration`` or ``django-email-confirmation``.

This application was inspired by bitbucket.org's email management system as well as 
the mentioned applications.

_________________
Assumption:
    * - Django user has been created 
        * - Either via proper registration and activation or via the admin interface or scripts
    * - This application first looks for its templates in: EMAIL_MGR_TEMPLATE_PATH, then
        it looks for <template_dir>/emailmgr/
        * - This way, projects can place the required templates at a location of their choice
            relative to the <tempalate_dir> of course
    * - Three templates are found in the template directory as stated above
        * - email subject template - emailmgr_activation_subject.txt
            * - extra context: current_site
        * - email message body template - emailmgr_activation_message.txt
            * - extra context: current_site, activate_url & user
        * - email list & manipulation template - emailmgr_email_list.html
            * - extra context: emails_list and add_email_form
                * - email_list includes all emails for this users
                    * - sorted by: 
                        1. primary - set directly via django or by emailmgr
                        2. activated - confirmed emails and can be set primary
                        3. not activated but activation email sent
                        5. not activated and activation email not sent
                * - add_email_form is a form for adding a new email address to a user

1. This app latches on the ``post_save`` signals for (user) and execute the following:
    A. Creates an email address object with the following attributes
        * - email = user.email (if not blank)
        * - is_active = True
        * - is_primary = True
        * - is_activation_sent = Don't care
        * - identifier = a random string (used for activation)
        * - Note: user login is not required
        * - Note: email is only created if user has a valid email address
        * - Note: this email is automatically considered as primary and activation is skipped

    A. Deletes all email addresses associated with the (just) deleted user
    
3. Provides URL to:

        * - http://example.com/email/add/, 
        * - Email address is created and associated with the logged in user
        * - Email address remains inactive and cannot be made primary
        * - User is redirected to http://example.com/email/list/
        * - ``email_list`` and ``email_form`` are passed into the template
        
    B. Deletes an email address from a user account
        * - http://example.com/email/delete/<identifier>/, 
        * - Existing email address with the above identifier is deleted
        * - Primary email address cannot be delete
        * - Once the email is deleted, user is redirected to http://example.com/email/list/
        
    C. Sends activation link for a newly added email address (sendto = user's primary email address)
        * - http://example.com/email/send_activation/<identifier>/, 
        * - An activation email is sent to the logged in user's primary address
        * - Note: all emails remain inactive unless activated
        * - Once the email is sent, user is redirected to http://example.com/email/list/

    D. Activates an email address when user clicks on an activation link
        * - http://example.com/email/activate/<identifier>/,
        * - Note: link was emailed to user's primary email address
        * - Matched email will be activated (then eligible to be promoted to primary)
        * - Once the email is activated, user is redirected to http://example.com/email/list/

    E. Makes an activated email address the primary email
        * - http://example.com/email/make_primary/<identifier>/,
        * - Only activated email addresses can be promoted to be the primary email address
